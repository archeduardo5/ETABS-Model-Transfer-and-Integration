# ETABSModelTransfer

ETABSModelTransfer is a tool that converts the geometry of an ETABS model into a CSV file. This conversion makes it easy to import the model into other software platforms such as Revit, Rhino, or other structural design tools. 

## Features
- Converts ETABS model geometry to CSV format.
- Allows seamless import into software like Revit, Rhino, or other compatible programs.
- Simplifies the process of cross-platform model exchange.

## Usage

1. **Export Geometry from ETABS**: 
   - Run the ETABSModelTransfer script to export the model's geometry data.
   
2. **CSV File Generation**:
   - The tool generates a CSV file containing the geometry data, such as nodes, beams, and elements.
   
3. **Import into Other Software**:
   - Use the generated CSV file to easily import the model into applications like Revit, Rhino, or any other software that supports CSV import.
